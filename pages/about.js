            I'm a designer, entrepreneur, and all-around curious person who
            can't get enough of exploring new ideas and asking lots of
            questions.

            I'm currently interested in exploring better ways to collaborate.
            This has led me to create the
            <Link href="https://www.facilitator.school">
              {" "}
              Facilitator School
            </Link>
            , an education platform with courses, resources, and tools around
            the topic of facilitation. Our goal is to help individuals develop
            the skills and knowledge necessary to create engaging, productive,
            and impactful gatherings.

            In my free time, you can usually find me reading books, cooking,
            playing board games, outside with the bicycle or simply spending
            time with those closest to me.
