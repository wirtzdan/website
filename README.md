Welcome behind the curtain of my personal website/portfolio. Take a look around.

This website is build using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React Framework), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) (Component Library) and [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/HsvqbADg) as a simple backend. The backend comes into play on the blog, books and tools page.

Read [this article](https://danielwirtz.com/blog/website-rebuild-nextjs-chakra-ui-airtable) to see how I'm using Airtable as a backend.

I think the most interesting pages to look at are:

- https://danielwirtz.com/blog
- https://danielwirtz.com/books
- https://danielwirtz.com/tools

## Get it running locally

To get this website running locally, type this into your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wirtzdan/website danielwirtz.com
```
```bash
$ cd danielwirtz.com
```
```bash
$ yarn

Make sure to add environmental variables, if you want to play around with the [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/HsvqbADg) and [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io) integration. To do so create a `.env.local` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/wirtzdan/website/blob/master/.env.example).
